## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report a vulnerability via Github issues. Any vulnerability shall be reported by emailing to Pana.Yang@hotmail.com or via our official website security reporting section (under construction).

## Developer Security Standards (Mandatory for Organization Members and Recommended for Contributors)

### **I. Authorized Operating Environment**

* **Recommended OS:** Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop
* **Disk Encryption:** LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) **must** be enabled by default during installation.

### **II. Mandatory Security Suite**

To ensure system integrity and real-time threat detection, the following tools must be installed and configured:

* **Endpoint Monitoring:** Wazuh-agent
* **Hardening & Auditing:** SELinux (set to `Enforcing`), firewalld, Lynis
* **Threat Scanning:** ClamAV, rkhunter, chkrootkit
* **System Integrity:** AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment), unhide
* **Network Scanning:** Daily Nmap scan of the local network (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
* **Security Server:** Wazuh-server (includes Wazuh-dashboard, Wazuh-manager and Wazuh-indexer), Greenbone Community Edition

### **III. Identity & Access Management**

* **2FA Requirement:** Hardware-based authentication via **YubiKey** is mandatory for all organizational accounts and SSH access.

# sysctl settings are defined through files in

#
# Vendors settings live in /usr/lib/sysctl.d/.
# To override a whole file, create a new file with the same in

# --- B. Filesystem / Permission Hardening ---

# Enable restriction of link/symlink traversal (to prevent user links in world-writable dirs)

# --- C. Resource and Memory Hardening ---

# Prevent non-root users from writing to /proc/sys/vm/*

# Restrict the dumping of memory (core dumps)
